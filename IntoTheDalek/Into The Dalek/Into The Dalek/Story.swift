You and the Doctor have just rescued the rebel fighter Journey Blue. Her shuttle was under attack from the Daleks.\n\n  Your Tardis stumbled into the battle and you joined the fight. Now you have returned her safely to her rebel base ship. You expect to enter to cheers, but instead, there is only silence...", "pageType": PageType.storyView],

The other is evil.\n\n  The officers will let you choose one Dalek... But upon doing so you must release it from its chains.\n\n  You can ask one Dalek one question.\n\n  You assume, as is the case with all Daleks... that the real Dalek will only lie. The good Dalek must only tell the truth.\n\n  What question do you ask?", "pageType": PageType.storyView],

It's a miracle.\n\n  A good Dalek does exist.\n\n  The Doctor asks, 'Do you have a shrink ray on board?'\n\n  Journey Blue answers, 'Of course!'\n\n  The Doctor explains his plan: you'll use the shrink ray to journey inside the good Dalek's mind.\n\n  You wait patiently while the shrink ray warms up...\n\n  5... 4... 3... 2... 1...","pageType": PageType.storyView],

This is a very complicated machine.\n\n  The Doctor explains that this room forms the Dalek's cortex vault. Dalek technology designed this vault to suppress any compassion... And also to store all of the Dalek's memories.\n\n  There's a simple keypad lock on the Dalek's central vault.\n\n  'Good news!' The Doctor says. 'Only 3 digits... And the Daleks only know 1s and 0s. This should be fairly easy to crack...'\n\n  'But we only get 5 tries, before it shuts down for 24 hours.'", "pageType": PageType.storyView],

He takes some atmospheric readings. He confirms -- this area is unguarded. But something very nearby is emitting a very high degree of radiation. You cannot stay inside this area for long...\n\n  You must leave. You must find the source of radiation. But how can you camouflage yourself?\n\n  The Doctor suggests you rub just enough garbage on yourself... '...to cover the smell.'\n\n  Yuck. You don't want to.\n\nThe Doctor suggests you solve the impasse with a game of RPSS.", "pageType": PageType.storyView],

Then something wonderful happens. All the images around you become the star being born. It's beautiful. Mesmerizing. You are transported. ...And so are the Doctor and the Dalek.\n\n  The Dalek tears up.
